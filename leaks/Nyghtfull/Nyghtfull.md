His first client, "Reality," was a rename of Tomorrow/Luna; it was very pasted and very bad, but had some bypasses due to him starting to work with Liticane. Afterwards, he made "Lithium" and "Echo," which were both Tenacity renames with some decent bypasses.

He got his address and full name leaked by Dark.

One of the reasons he's hated by the community is that a lot of the time he has been disrespectful to a lot of client developers, even making frankly bad expose videos, which is quite ironic considering he renames Tenacity, though a lot of the stuff in his videos is based on reality and those that weren't have been removed (such as the Atani client video), so I'll give him credit for that.

Nowadays, he's a pretty chill guy and a decent developer too, but I still wouldn't say he doesn't deserve at least some backlash from the community, as his past actions were not very cool.
