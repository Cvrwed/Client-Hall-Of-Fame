## Chazed AKA Phase
Originally exposed for renaming Memeware to "Nekoware".
The client was leaked by me and some friends; later, his face and IP were leaked.

He came back under a new alias known as Chazed. He later created the "Zyth" client, a pasted client based on the wavelength base.

After the source for that client was leaked by Hello_SW, he created Haptic.
Haptic was a Vestige rename and was also leaked by Hello_SW.
