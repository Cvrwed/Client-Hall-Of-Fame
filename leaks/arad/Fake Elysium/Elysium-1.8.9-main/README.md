# How to use
First, you need to download mcp 1.8.8, extract it & decompile it
then, you need clone this repository to somewhere like on your C:\Users
after you cloned it; open it and go in the "README" folder then, you gotta copy the entire "conf" folder
go on the mcp workspace, and delete "conf" and paste it from the clipboard,
then you can delete the "minecraft" in the src folder, move the .git into the src folder, and git pull!
