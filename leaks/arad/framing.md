## Updated Info

Apparently, this was not by Arad. Some group of people made a client to frame him; not everyone involved in developing the client was involved in framing Arad.

This client is not related to the real Elysium product by Arad (which can be found at discord.gg/vapev4).

No one really knows who did it or why, but anyway, it was not by Arad, and he should not be associated with it.
